QSnake
======

a very simple game written in Qt5 based on these rules:

* Snake grows every 10 steps by one unit
* every step a brick is spawn
* bricks tend to colonize
* every 100 steps a bomb appears
* bombs can be collected and used with the spacebar
* bombs have a radius of 10 units

# Controls
* arrow keys
* spacebar (reset game and trigger bombs)
* P for pausing the game

# Requirements
* Monitor with full HD resolution
* some CPU power, it is really now written efficiently
